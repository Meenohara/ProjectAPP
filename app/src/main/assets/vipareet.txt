Sit down with your support about five to six inches to your right side. Place a bolster or two-folded blankets close to your waist so that they can support you when you tilt backwards.
Take in a deep breath and while exhaling, tilt your torso slightly towards the bolster while swinging your legs up against the wall for support.
Allow the front portion of your torso to round up gently as you tilt yourself backwards and lie down. The bolster pillow or folded blankets should support your waist. If you find yourself slipping off, readjust your position and try again. You may need to move a little closer to the wall.
Feel the stretch from your pubis to your shoulders. Keep your legs straight up even if all you can think of is bending them.
Release the base of your skull and lift it away so that you soften the stretch that you feel on your throat. Tilt your head downwards, but do not allow your chin to touch the sternum.
Open up your shoulder blades and allow your arms to rest at your sides, with both the palms facing upwards.
To keep your legs firm and straight, release the weight of your torso and feel it weighing deep into the back of your pelvis.
Hold the pose for at least five minutes.
