Are you aware of your breathing rate?

Is your spine straight?

Always beware of shallow or knotty breathing. It indicates negative emotions.

The role of breath is very important in the practice of Asanas or Yoga positions or yoga postures. First we need to understand why breathing is incorporated in yoga practice. The breath is Prana or vital force. Our body requirements of oxygen or pranic energy are changing depending on our actions.

The spine is like the trunk of a tree, supporting the entire body structure. Atop this trunk sits the bony, enclosed cranium or box of the skull, containing the most important of all human organs- the brain- which not only controls the human body, but gives a real purpose to its existence.
